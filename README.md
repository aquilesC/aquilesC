# Hi there 👋

## Main Occupation
I'm the R&D manager of [Dispertech](https://www.dispertech.com), a high-tech company from **Amsterdam**. We build next-generation nanoparticle tracking devices that allow researchers to measure the size of very small objects, such as viruses and extracellular vesicles. I take care of all things technical, such as:

- Hardware design and construction
- Instrumentation software (see: [Experimentor](https://github.com/aquilesC/experimentor))
- Data analysis software (see: [Disperpy](https://github.com/aquilesC/Disperpy) )

## Book
I have self-published an e-book, Python for the Lab, check it out [here](https://gum.co/kgSsv)

## Hobbies

- 🌱 I am building a [Digital Garden](https://www.aquicarattino.com/blog/one-month-learning-public/) at [aquiles.me](https://aquiles.me), which is my personal attempt at learning in public. The code powering it is [here](https://github.com/aquilesC/static_website_builder).

- 🔭 I am writing at [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com), all things Python and instrument control.
